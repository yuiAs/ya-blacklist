# Project Guidelines

## Coding Conventions

### General Rules
- Always use TypeScript with strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`; avoid `var`
- Use async/await over Promise chains
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Commit Strategy
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### Commit Conventions
Write clear commit messages using Conventional Commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style.

- The subject SHOULD BE written in English whenever possible
- For everything else, use clear language, primarily English
- If you ask a user for a JIRA ticket or GitHub Issue number and receive a meaningful response, include `Refs: <Ticket>` in the footer (e.g., if no string is returned, there is no need to include it)

## Branch Strategy
- main: For Production. DO NOT PUSH DIRECTORY.
- develop: Integration Branch. MUST BE REQUIRED PR.
- feature/<short-description>: Feature Developments
- fix/<short-description>: Bug Fixes
- bugfix/<short-description>: Bug Fixes (same as fix)
- release/<version>: Release Candidates. MUST BE REQURIED PR.

Create these branches from the develop branch unless otherwise instructed.  
For example, fix branches for specific feature branches do not need to be create from develop.

## PR (Pull Request) Strategy
- Write subjects using Conventional Commits (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style.
- All descriptions must be written in Japanese by default
